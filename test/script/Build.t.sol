/// `generatedContracts()` is the one list every hook inside `Build` reads, so
/// the regeneration, the released-lib writer and the freeze cannot disagree
/// with each other. The boundary is where they can: what this repo deploys is
/// declared in `RaindexDeploySuites.candidateSuites()`, and the generator's
/// list is a second hard-coded array in a second file.
///
/// A candidate dropped from `generatedContracts()` by a refactor or a merge
/// still compiles, because its committed snapshot is still there and still
/// imported. `cutRelease()` then freezes only the contracts the generator
/// names, `regenerateLibs()` writes a released-suites lib only for those, and
/// the release permanently omits that contract. Nothing downstream can see it:
/// `testEveryFrozenSnapshotIsReleased` walks record -> declaration, so a record
/// entry never written is invisible to it, and `RaindexDeployChainTest` is
/// never handed the omitted suite. The frozen tag then cannot be re-cut, so the
/// hole is permanent.
///
/// Deliberately nothing here calls `run()` or `cutRelease()`. Both rewrite the
/// committed `src/generated/` snapshots and `src/lib/` libs that other test
/// contracts read, and forge runs test contracts in parallel — a contract
/// rewriting what another one is reading is a race, not a check. Nothing below
/// writes anything.

/// repos: this repo emits no generated alias libs, so `GeneratedContract` has
