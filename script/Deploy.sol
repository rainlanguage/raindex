/// @notice `RainDeployBroadcast` over this repo's one suite declaration:
/// selects a suite by `DEPLOYMENT_SUITE` and deploys it through the Zoltu
/// factory, after anchoring every candidate snapshot to current source.
/// Broadcasts to every network in `LibRainDeploy.supportedNetworks()` — the

/// address on every supported chain.

/// The sub-parser's described-by meta emission is NOT part of this broadcast —
/// `RainDeployBroadcast.run` has no post-deploy hook — it moved to
/// `script/DescribeSubParser.sol`, dispatched separately.
