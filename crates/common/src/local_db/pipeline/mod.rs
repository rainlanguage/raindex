//! Split-traits API for the local DB sync engine.
//!
//! This module defines minimal, focused traits that partition sync
//! responsibilities into composable units. Environment-specific behavior
//! (browser vs producer) is provided by implementing these traits; the core
//! orchestrator depends only on the traits and does not
//! branch on environment.
