# @rainlanguage/orderbook — Architecture

This package is the JavaScript/TypeScript SDK that exposes Rain Orderbook functionality to web and Node.js consumers. It packages the Rust WASM crate surface (primarily `rain_orderbook_js_api`, plus re‑exports from sibling crates) into a single, installable NPM module with CJS and ESM entry points.

The SDK is designed to work in browsers, Node.js, and hybrid runtimes. It embeds the compiled `.wasm` bytes directly in the published bundle so consumers do not need network fetches or filesystem access at runtime.


## Overview

- Purpose
  - Provide a WASM‑backed API for: YAML parsing/validation, orderbook queries (subgraph), quoting, vault management, transaction calldata generation (add/remove, deposit/withdraw), GUI helpers to deploy orders from dotrain, and low‑level hashing/ABI helpers.
- Targets
  - ESM (browser) and CJS (Node.js) builds are both published.
  - The WASM is base64‑embedded to avoid runtime `fetch`/`fs` requirements.
- Upstream crates
  - Backed by `rain_orderbook_js_api` (WASM cdylib) which re‑exports `rain_orderbook_app_settings`, `rain_orderbook_common`, and `rain_orderbook_subgraph_client` for a unified JS surface.

Typical import

```ts
import { RaindexClient, DotrainOrderGui, parseYaml, getOrderHash } from "@rainlanguage/orderbook";
```


## Build & Packaging

All builds should be run inside a Nix shell to ensure toolchain parity (`nix develop -c <cmd>`).

- Entry generation (`scripts/build.js`)
  - Writes thin top‑level entry files: `cjs.js` (CommonJS re‑export), `esm.js` (ESM re‑export), plus `.d.ts` stubs.
  - Creates `dist/cjs` and `dist/esm` directories.
  - Invokes `npm run build-wasm` to compile the Rust workspace to `wasm32-unknown-unknown` in release mode (excludes CLI and integration tests).
  - For each package (currently just `js_api`), calls `scripts/buildPackage.js` to produce JS bindings and package artifacts.
- WASM binding & embedding (`scripts/buildPackage.js`)
  - Runs `wasm-bindgen` twice to generate Node (CJS) and Web (ESM) wrappers from the compiled `.wasm`. The `wasm-bindgen` binary comes from the Nix environment.
  - Reads the generated `.wasm` files and writes `dist/cjs/orderbook_wbg.json` and `dist/esm/orderbook_wbg.json` containing base64‑encoded bytes.
  - Rewrites the generated JS to:
    - CJS: read bytes from the embedded JSON via `Buffer.from(base64)` and initialize the module without touching the filesystem.
    - ESM: import the embedded JSON and use top‑level `await __wbg_init(bytes)` to initialize the WASM before exporting symbols.
  - Copies type declarations to `dist/*/index.d.ts` and prefixes generated files with a note that they are auto‑generated.
- Prepublish bootstrap (`scripts/setup.js`)
  - If `./dist` exists, exits early (supporting installs from already‑built tarballs).
  - Otherwise, cleans temp/outputs and runs the full build inside Nix: `nix develop -c node scripts/build`.
- Type checking & tests
  - `npm run check` runs `tsc` over the built JS to validate the emitted types.
  - `npm run test` executes Vitest suites under `test/` against the built artifacts.

Key commands

- Build: `nix develop -c npm run build`
- Test: `nix develop -c npm run test`
- Docs: `nix develop -c npm run docs`


## Directory Layout

- `cjs.js`, `esm.js` — Top‑level re‑exports pointing at `dist/` (published files).
- `cjs.d.ts`, `esm.d.ts` — Type re‑export stubs for consumers.
- `dist/` — Build output (published)
  - `cjs/`
    - `index.js` — Auto‑generated CommonJS glue that initializes WASM from `orderbook_wbg.json`.
    - `index.d.ts` — Type declarations.
    - `orderbook_wbg.json` — Base64‑encoded WASM bytes.
  - `esm/`
    - `index.js` — Auto‑generated ESM glue with top‑level `await` for WASM init.
    - `index.d.ts` — Type declarations.
    - `orderbook_wbg.json` — Base64‑encoded WASM bytes.
- `scripts/`
  - `build.js` — Orchestrates the full build.
  - `buildPackage.js` — Runs `wasm-bindgen`, embeds WASM, writes JS/TS outputs.
  - `setup.js` — Prepublish bootstrap inside Nix.
- `test/` — Vitest suites exercising bindings (bindings/common/js_api).
- `typedoc.json`, `tsconfig.json` — Documentation and TS settings for the published surface.
- `README.md` — End‑user SDK guide with examples.


## Exports & API Surface

The package re‑exports the WASM‑bound API from the Rust crates. Representative items:

- Functions
  - `parseYaml`, `getOrderHash`, `getTakeOrders3Calldata`, `keccak256`, `keccak256HexString`.
- High‑level classes (selected)
  - `RaindexClient` — orderbook queries (orders, trades, vaults, quotes, transactions) across configured networks/subgraphs. Constructor is async (`await RaindexClient.new(...)`) and accepts optional `queryCallback` (for applying fetched records to the local DB), `wipeCallback` (for cleaning up stale data during full re-sync), and `statusCallback` (for reporting sync progress/errors to the caller) args for local DB sync when the YAML has `local-db-sync` sections. The sync scheduler starts automatically when configured and shuts down via Drop.
  - `RaindexOrder`, `RaindexVault`, `RaindexTrade`, `RaindexTransaction`, `RaindexVaultsList`, etc.
  - `DotrainOrder`, `DotrainOrderGui`, `DotrainRegistry` — dotrain parsing, GUI orchestration, registry fetching (including `getOrderbookYaml()` for token queries), and deployment calldata.
  - `OrderbookYaml` — typed access to networks, tokens (via `getTokens()`), orderbooks, subgraphs, deployers, accounts, metaboards.
  - `Float` — arbitrary‑precision float utilities used across the API.
- Errors & results
  - Most methods return `WasmEncodedResult<T>` with either `{ value }` or `{ error: { msg, readableMsg } }` for ergonomic, user‑readable error handling in JS.

Notes on runtime behavior

- ESM builds use top‑level `await` to initialize the WASM module before exports are used. Ensure your bundler/runtime supports top‑level await.
- No network fetches are performed to load the WASM bytes; they are embedded via JSON.


## How It Fits The Workspace

- Rust crates under `crates/*` implement the core logic. `rain_orderbook_js_api` compiles to WASM and re‑exports pieces of `common`, `settings`, `subgraph`, and others for a cohesive JS surface.
- This package is the NPM wrapper that compiles those crates for WASM, generates JS glue, and publishes the resulting SDK.
- Consumers use only `@rainlanguage/orderbook`; no direct interaction with the Rust build is required.


## Testing & Documentation

- Tests: Vitest suites under `test/` validate representative flows: orders/vaults/trades queries, quoting, calldata generation, GUI flows, and error surfaces.
- Docs: `npm run docs` builds TypeDoc from the emitted `.d.ts` for hosted API documentation.


## Publishing & Versioning

- The `prepublish` script ensures the package is fully rebuilt within a Nix shell and includes the embedded WASM. Tarballs contain `dist/` and thin top‑level entry points.
- Node.js >= 22 is required (see `package.json#engines`). A small `buffer` dependency is bundled for ESM environments that lack a native `Buffer`.


## Caveats & Tips

- Always run build/test inside `nix develop` so `wasm-bindgen`, Rust toolchains, and targets are available.
- If you add new WASM crates/exports in the workspace, extend the `packages` array in `scripts/build.js` and mirror any binding tweaks in `scripts/buildPackage.js`.
- If you see initialization issues in the browser, confirm your bundler supports top‑level await and that `orderbook_wbg.json` is included in the bundle.
